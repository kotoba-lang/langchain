(ns langchain.edn-persist
  "The repository-first persistence contract, as policy plus an injected store.

  Transactions remain editable, local EDN while an agent is running. The cloud
  host may later encrypt and publish the whole state file through Kagi, DataLad
  and a Kotobase head. Every append re-reads the state while holding a lock, so
  unrelated keys written directly by an agent are preserved instead of being
  replaced by a stale in-memory snapshot.

  ## Why this is `.cljc` now

  It was `langchain.edn-persist`, a JVM host, and it was the last `.clj` in this
  library's runtime surface. That mattered beyond tidiness: measured 2026-08-27,
  it is what stopped `cloud.itonami.app.store` — the namespace the largest group
  of otherwise-portable namespaces waits on — from being portable at all. One
  `.clj` in a dependency is enough to hold a whole graph on the JVM.

  The split follows `kotoba.lang.fs`, which solved the same problem for the
  filesystem: the decisions are pure and live here, the effects go behind a
  protocol a host implements and injects, and an in-memory implementation ships
  with it so the policy can be exercised with no host at all.

  ## The three layers

  - **Policy** (pure, this namespace): what a valid stream name is, how EDN is
    read, what the next state is after an append, which events answer a cursor.
  - **`IStateStore`** (protocol): read the text, write the text, hold the lock.
    Three operations, because that is all the policy needs to be durable.
  - **Hosts**: `memory-store` here; the filesystem-backed one below, whose
    read/write/lock are the only reader-conditional code in the file.

  A host that is not a filesystem — a Worker with a KV binding, a browser with
  IndexedDB — implements the same three operations and reuses every line of the
  policy."

  "The EDN rules for a repository state document.

  UNKNOWN tagged literals are refused rather than read: this text is editable by
  an agent, and a reader tag is a call into whatever the host happens to have
  registered.

  `#inst` and `#uuid` are the exception, and they are not refused — they are
  built into `clojure.edn` itself, so `:default` is never consulted for them.
  Measured 2026-08-27 on both runtimes, which agree: both read, `#evil/tag`
  refuses. Said explicitly because the JVM-only version of this docstring
  claimed tagged literals were refused full stop, and that claim survived as
  long as one runtime was the only one anybody ran. The two built-ins construct
  a Date and a UUID from a literal and reach no host code, which is why they are
  admitted rather than blocked.

  `#js` is built in on ClojureScript ONLY, and is refused by name below so the
  two runtimes agree. Without that, a document written by a Node host could be
  read there and rejected on the JVM — the format would depend on who opened
  it, which is the one thing a shared state file cannot afford.

  `nil` text — no document yet — is an empty map, which is what makes the first
  append the same code path as every later one."
