  "JVM host for the repository-first persistence contract.

  Transactions remain editable, local EDN while an agent is running.  The
  cloud host may later encrypt and publish the whole state file through Kagi,
  DataLad, and a Kotobase head.  Every append re-reads the file while holding a
  process-safe lock, so unrelated keys written directly by an agent are
  preserved instead of being replaced by a stale in-memory snapshot."
