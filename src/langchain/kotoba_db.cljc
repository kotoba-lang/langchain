  "Kotoba-server XRPC backend implementing the langchain.db/api contract.

  Instead of an in-process EAV store, every operation is a POST to a
  running kotoba-server pod via the datomic.* XRPC namespace:

    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.transact  → :transact!
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.q         → :q
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.pull      → :pull
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.entid     → :entid

  Pass the kotoba-api map as :db-api to datomic-checkpointer,
  langchain.memory/datomic-chat-history, etc.:

    (require '[langchain.kotoba-db    :as kdb]
             '[langgraph.checkpoint   :as cp])

    (def api  (kdb/kotoba-api  jvm-host-caps))
    (def cp   (cp/datomic-checkpointer conn {:db-api api}))

                    the edge derives + verifies the target graph

  A Datomic-style 2-tuple lookup ref (`[attr value]`, what `crm.store` and
