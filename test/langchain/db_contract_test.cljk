(ns langchain.db-contract-test
  "The `langchain.db` invariants every consumer stands on and that no test
  looked at.

  `db-test` covers the API surface: a query joins, an upsert merges, a pull
  nests, `as-of` rewinds. Each of those was written alongside the code it
  covers, so each passes for the reason its author had in mind. This
  namespace asks the other question — **what would still be green if
  `db.cljc` regressed?** — and pins the answers.

  It matters more here than in most places. `langchain.db` is not one of
  this library's leaves; it is the store `langchain-store` wraps and, through
  it, the 316 `cloud-itonami` repositories that depend on that wrapper. A
  silent change here does not fail: it writes a second entity, or replays a
  history that disagrees with the process that wrote it.

  Each test below was watched go red against a deliberately broken copy of
  `db.cljc` before it landed — the mutation is named in each docstring and
  recorded in the superproject's `scripts/maturity-loop/mutations.edn`
  (suite `orgs/kotoba-lang/langchain`). All three mutations were first
  confirmed to leave the pre-existing suite entirely green: 153 tests / 535
  assertions, 0 failures, once per mutation. A test whose mutation the old
  suite already caught is not closing a gap, and saying which is the point
  of writing them down."

;; ═════════════ 1. the unique attribute resolves from anywhere ═════════════

(deftest upsert-resolves-through-the-unique-attr-wherever-it-sits-in-the-map
  "`expand-entity-map` sorts a map's attributes so unique ones are emitted
  first, because a tempid is bound by the FIRST op that mentions it — and
  only a unique attribute can resolve that op onto an existing entity.
  Drop the sort and the tempid is bound by whichever attribute the map
  happens to yield first; if that one is not unique, the transaction
  allocates a fresh eid and the `:db.unique/identity` attribute is written
  onto a SECOND entity carrying the same identity value.

  Nothing raises. Both entities are well-formed, this store never enforces
  uniqueness at the datom level (its ns docstring says so), and every
  scalar query keeps answering — with whichever of the two it reaches
  first.

  `db-test`'s upsert test cannot see this. It writes
  `{:person/id \"alice\" :person/age 31}`, where the unique attribute is
  already first in the literal's insertion order, so the sort has nothing
  to do and removing it changes nothing. The map has to be written the
  other way round for the sort to be load-bearing — which is the ordinary
  case, not the exotic one: `langchain-store/map->tx` builds its tx map
  with `reduce-kv` over a field spec, so the order is the spec author's
  domain order and the identity attribute lands wherever they wrote it.

  Mutation: `:langchain/entity-map-loses-unique-first-ordering`."

;; ═══════ 2. a replacement is a retraction plus an add, in tx-data ═══════

(deftest replacing-a-value-retracts-the-old-one-in-tx-data
  "Overwriting a cardinality-one attribute retracts the previous datom, and
  the retraction has to appear in `:tx-data` — not just in `:datoms`.

  `:tx-data` is not a diagnostic here, it is what `as-of` replays. `as-of`
  folds each logged transaction's `:tx-data` straight into `:datoms`
  (`:db/add` conj, `:db/retract` disj); it does not go back through
  `apply-add`, so it cannot re-derive a retraction that was never written
  down. Drop the retraction from `:tx-data` while still applying it to
  `:datoms` and the live process stays correct while `as-of`, replayed
  THROUGH the replacement, returns a cardinality-one attribute holding both
  values — a db no writer could have produced.

  **The PERSIST path does not share this exposure, and this test says so
  rather than leaving it implied.** `create-conn`'s persist arity replays
  each event through `with`, which runs `apply-add`, which recomputes the
  retraction against the db it is rebuilding. Measured against the mutation
  below: the persist assertion here stays GREEN while the `as-of` one goes
  red. It is kept because the asymmetry is the fact worth having — the two
  replay paths are not interchangeable, and only one of them depends on
  tx-data fidelity — but on this mutation it is a passenger, not a second
  detector. Writing it down beats a later reader assuming the coverage is
  symmetric because both lines are here.

  `as-of-test` comes close and cannot see it: it does replace a value, then
  reads `as-of` the tx BEFORE the replacement, which replays only the add
  that is still there. Reading at the later tx is the whole difference.
  `persist-test` replays a log that only ever ADDS, so it has no retraction
  to lose either way.

  Mutation: `:langchain/tx-data-drops-the-retraction` — 2 of these 4
  assertions go red, the tx-data one and the as-of one."

;; ═════ 3. only a unique attribute may claim an existing entity ═════

(deftest an-entity-with-no-unique-attribute-gets-a-fresh-identity
  "A tempid is resolved onto an existing entity only when the attribute
  binding it is declared `:db/unique`. Widen that to any attribute — an
  inviting change, since `entid` will happily match any `[a v]` pair — and
  every entity that has no unique attribute at all silently merges into the
  first existing entity that shares its leading attribute value.

  Chat memory is exactly that shape. `langchain.memory/append!` writes
  `{:msg/thread <e> :msg/index n :msg/content .. :msg/data ..}`, which
  declares no unique attribute, so every message in a thread leads with the
  same `:msg/thread` value. Under the widened rule the second message
  resolves onto the first, the third onto the first, and a conversation
  collapses into a single entity that holds only its most recent turn. The
  transaction succeeds and the history is simply shorter than it was.

  This test uses the message shape rather than the store's own fixture
  because that is where the invariant is load-bearing, and asserts on
  entity identity rather than on a count of readable messages — a count
  alone cannot say whether two rows are two entities or one entity read
  twice.
