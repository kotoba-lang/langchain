  "Invariants of tool definition and tool-call execution.

  `langchain.tool` is the point where model output becomes an actual call
  into caller code, and where a thrown exception has to become a message
  the model can read instead of a crash that ends the loop. Two other test
  namespaces used it to build fixtures; none pinned that contract."
