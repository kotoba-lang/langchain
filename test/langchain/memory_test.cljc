  "Contract of langchain.memory/datomic-chat-history.

  Chat history is the one store in this library whose *shape* is not
  self-evident from a round-trip: every operation is scoped to a thread,
  and every scope is expressed as a join the query engine is free to
  satisfy some other way if the join is written wrong. A store that
  answers plausibly for a single thread can still be wrong the moment a
  second conversation exists -- which is the only state a chat history is
  ever in outside a test. So each test here keeps two threads alive and
  asserts about both: the one under test, and the one that must not move."
