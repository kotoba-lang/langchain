(ns langchain.message-test
  "Invariants of the chat message data model.

  Before this file, `langchain.message` had no test of its own: five other
  test namespaces required it as a helper for building fixtures, which
  exercises the constructors incidentally but pins none of the properties
  the rest of the library relies on -- that absent metadata stays absent,
  that an empty tool-call list reads as nil, and that content blocks are
  readable whether their keys survived a JSON round-trip as keywords or
  as strings."
