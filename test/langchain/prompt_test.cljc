  "Invariants of prompt templates.

  `langchain.prompt` was reachable from two other test namespaces as a
  fixture builder, but nothing pinned the substitution rules themselves:
  which key styles resolve, what happens to a variable that is not there,
  and that both template records really do satisfy IRunnable rather than
  merely being called as functions."
