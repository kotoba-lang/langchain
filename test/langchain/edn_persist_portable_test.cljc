  "The persistence policy and the store contract, on both runtimes.

  `edn_persist_test.clj` covers the same namespace through the FILESYSTEM host
  — temp directories, a real lock, concurrent JVM threads — and stays JVM-only
  because those are JVM facts. This file covers what is left when the host is
  taken away, which is where the decisions are, and it runs anywhere.

  The `memory-store` here is not a mock. It is the implementation this library
  ships for a standalone run, so these assertions exercise shipped code rather
  than a stand-in written for the test."
