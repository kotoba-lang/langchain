  "Pins the shape of docs/catalog.edn, the upstream provenance catalog.

  The catalog's whole value is that every row was actually fetched. A URL
  carrying an :http status and a :verified date claims a measurement; a
  row added without one is a citation nobody took. So this test refuses
  rows that skip the discipline, refuses :mirrors paths this repo does
  not have (provenance for nothing), and refuses duplicate URLs.

  The duplicate rule is not decoration. Nine of upstream's per-concept
  documentation pages now redirect into one overview page, so recording
  them at their historical addresses would have turned one source into
  nine citations while every row stayed individually true.

  It cannot re-fetch: the suite runs with no network by design (the whole
  library injects HTTP rather than performing it), so :http here is the
  recorded measurement, not a live one. What IS checked live is
  everything this repo can answer about itself.

  Written as .cljc and listed in test/portable_nbb.cljs so both runtimes
  ask it. Both are invoked from the repository root, which is what the
  relative path below resolves against."
